# RSS Reader version 4.0 by AlexSpaceBy (fiz.zagorodnAA@gmail.com)

First, second, third and fourth iteration.

## General description:

The RssReader program takes rss url and receives news and print it in console in following form:

*========================================== RSS Reader ==============================*
*Feed: Channel feed*
*Title: Title of the news*
*Date: Day, Month year hh.mm.ss*
*Link: Link to full news*

*TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT*
*TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT*
*TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT*

*Image: Image for the news, if available.*
*(News separator). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .*

*Next news*

*...*

*=================================End for news=======================================*

To run the program, you should do the following:

*For Windows:*
     1. Run console as Administrator (mandatory)
     2. Type the following: `rss-reader [url] [flags] [parameters]`
*For Linux:*
     1. Type the following: `sudo rss-reader `[url] [flags] [parameters]`

Program has a number of flags described below, that can be used to control it. 
Program logs all events to `logJournal.log` file. Program writes all news to `news.log` file. 

## Program flags

Program behavior is guided by a number of flags:

`-v` - Print the version of the program in console (use: `-v`).
`-h` - Print the help message (use: `-h`).
`-b` - Print logs from logJournal to console (use: `[url] -b`).
`-j` - Print news in JSON format to console( use: `[url] -j`).
`-l` - Limit the number of news topics (use: `[url] -l [number]`).
`-d` - Date to print the news with it from history (use: `[url] -d [YYYYmmdd]`).
`-p` - Convert news to pdf and store it locally (use: `[url] -p [destination folder]`).
`-hl` - Convert news to html and store it locally(use: `[url] -hl [destination folder]`).


## logJournal

There are three main types of events:

*1. INFO*
*2. WARNING*
*3. ERROR*

To see log journal, one needs to use `[-b]` flag. 

*For Windows:* Log Journal is stored in the default Python directory (in my case: `C:\Program Files\Python38\Lib\site-packages\rss_reader`).


*For Linux:* Log Journal is stored in the default Python directory (in my case: `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rss_reader`).

## Program logic description

The program has a builtin checker that checks whether the `[url]` is an actual url. 
The url must have the following format: `https://nameofthesite.domain[/rest part of the link]`.
In case `[url]` is wrong, the program tells suggests you either to change the `[ur]` or to quit.
If `[url]` looks like url, the program tryes to check if there is a server on the other side. 
If the server is not available, the program will try to reconnect to it in 10 seconds. Three
attempts will be made. In the server is not available, the program asks you either to change `[url]`
or to quit. If there is a server on the other side, the program tries to take RSS Feed. If `[url]` leads to
site, server, or something that doesn't have RSS feed, the program will ask you either to change `[url]` or to quit.
If everything is ok, the program will print news to console. The `[-l]` flag set up the limit for the news to print to console.
By default the program stores the news in local news.log file. The `[-d]` flag with `YYYYmmdd` format prints all news corresponding to
the `YYYYmmdd` date. The detailed description of news storage is described below. There is an option to convert nwes to pdf. The detailed
description of this option is provided below.

## JSON format

There is a builtin JSON converter that converts the output to the specified format. The converter envokes by using `[-j]` flag.
It prints the news in JSON format to console (by using json library). The program uses the folloving JSON formatting:

{
"feed": string,
"link": string,
"title": string,
"date": datetime,
"description": string,
"image": string
}

The whole feed can be stored in JSON format by using the following formatting:

{
int: {
       "feed": string,
        "link": string,
        "title": string,
        "date": datetime,
        "description": string,
        "image": string
     },
int: {
       "feed": string,
        "link": string,
        "title": string,
        "date": datetime,
        "description": string,
        "image": string
     },
...
int: {
       "feed": string,
        "link": string,
        "title": string,
        "date": datetime,
        "description": string,
        "image": string
     }
}

Maximum int corresponds either to `[-l]` flag, or to the whole number of news for the server (for some it can be 50, for some it can be 100). 

## newsLog journal

By default RssReader stores all news taken from the Internet in news.log file in the following format:

*!!!#####STARTOFNEWS#####!!!YYYYmmdd*
*Feed: (line with feed)*
*Title: (line with litle)*
*Date: (line with date)*
*Link: (line with link)*
*Image: (line with image)*
 
*TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT*
*TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT*
*TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT*

*. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .*
*!!!#####ENDOFNEWS#####!!!YYYYmmdd*

The first and the last line show the beginning and the end of news respectively. When one send `-d YYYYmmdd` command, the program searches
through all journal for the news that strat with `!!!#####STARTOFNEWS#####!!!YYYYmmdd` and ends with `!!!#####ENDOFNEWS#####!!!YYYYmmdd` and
prints all lines in between. There is a builtin function that does preliminary check of date. If date is from the future, the program will tell about it.
If there is no news.log file (that may happened if you run the program for the first time, the news.log in this case have not existed yet) or there is
no news that corresponds to the specified `YYYYmmdd` date, the program will tell about it.
There is a builtin function that checks whether the news has been already added to the local storage. If so, the program logs the attempt, and does not add it to
the local storage. To use this function the program takes the link for the news and checks if there is a news with the same link.

Typical usage (provided you have the news log in your local storage, if not, just provide a valid rss url to create one):

               `rss-reader -d 20191119` - prints all news for 2019.11.19 to console from local storage

               `rss-reader -d 20191119 -l 10` - prints 10 news for 2019.11.19 to console from local storage

*For Windows:* News Journal is stored in the default Python directory (in my case: `C:\Program Files\Python38\Lib\site-packages\rss_reader`).

*For Linux:* News Journal is stored in the default Python directory (in my case: `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/rss_reader`).

## Convert news to pdf or html

The program can convert the news to pdf or html. It can take either news from the Internet, or from local storage. The program converts news to pdf by invoking `[-p]` flag.
The program converts news to html by invoking `[-hl]` flag.In the document the program provide all data about the news, including image and link. If the image is not available, or corrupted,
the program will let you know about it. The image and link are interactive and can be used as URL for the sourse by clicking. Due to saving of free space on hard drive, the program cashes only text
information and link to the news. When you convert news from local storage, the program downloads the picture from the Internet. In there is no Internet, the program converts the
news from local storage, but instead of picture, it draws notice that there is no Internet connection.

Typical usage of the pdf converter (if it was installed from the package):

                                  `rss-reader https://news.yahoo.com/rss/ -p C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\` - convert all news from the feed to pdf. 

                                  `rss-reader https://news.yahoo.com/rss/ -p C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\ -l 10` - convert 10 news from the feed to pdf.

                                  `rss-reader https://news.yahoo.com/rss/ -p C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\ -l 10 -j` - convert 10 news from the json feed to pdf.

                                  `rss-reader -b -p C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\` - convert log journal to pdf

                                  `rss-reader -d 20191119 -p C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\` - convert all news from the local storage to pdf for 20191119.

                                  `rss-reader -d 20191119 -p C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\ -l 10` - convert 10 news from the local storage to pdf for 20191119.

                                  `rss-reader https://news.yahoo.com/rss/ -hl C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\` - convert all news from the feed to html. 

                                  `rss-reader https://news.yahoo.com/rss/ -hl C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\ -l 10` - convert 10 news from the feed to html.

                                  `rss-reader -b -hl C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\` - convert log journal to html/

                                  `rss-reader -d 20191119 -hl C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\` - convert all news from the local storage to pdf for 20191119.

                                  `rss-reader -d 20191119 -hl C:\Users\User\Destination_Folder\ -l 10` - convert 10 news from the local storage to pdf for 20191119.



The `Destination_Folder\` is a folder where files after pdf conversion will be stored. The `\` in the end of the path is a mandatory for the program. If the `Destination_Folder` does not exist,
or you have no permission to create pdf inside it, the program will let you know. Since pdf convertion is a heavy weight procedure, it can take time. If ther is no errors, just wait until it converts.  

## General issues

Since for every RSS `[url]` can be implemented it own format, that does not fully comply with RSS specification, the program uses
html2text library to make the news text more readable. Since the program uses `argparse` standart library, there is somr difficulties with exceptions.
Namely, all Exceptions in this library inherits from Exception class, not from BaseExceptions. Because of it, all exceptions work the way they don't ment to be.
