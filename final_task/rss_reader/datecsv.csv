Mon, 18 Nov 2019 13:57:49 -0500	Israel’s New Way of War	https://news.yahoo.com/israel-way-war-185749787.html	Commuters on Route 4, driving toward the Israeli coastal city of Ashdod onNovember 12, were shocked by an explosion, a rocket impact next to a majorintersection. Had it fallen on a car or one of the many trucks plying theroute, there would have been deaths, and the road would have been closed.Instead, police and Israeli Home Front Command units came and cordoned off thesidewalk, and drivers went about their day. Twenty-five miles south of wherethe rocket landed, other rocket teams from Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), anIranian-backed terrorist group, were preparing to fire more than 400 rocketsat Israel during a brief flare-up in fighting. Most of them would beintercepted by Israel’s high-tech air defense.The ability of millions ofIsraelis to mostly go about their day while Israel’s air force carries outprecision air strikes nearby is due to Israel’s latest achievements infighting war. It also comes with questions about whether Israel is beingeffective and what this latest revolution in military affairs means in thelong term.A week after the November 12 clashes, they had faded into thebackground, one day of battle among dozens since March 2018, when Hamaslaunched a series of protests called the Great Return March. More than 2,000rockets have been fired, many of them in short spurts. Several times, Israelalmost launched a major ground operation. But it has held back. Its Iron Domeair-defense system, which looks like a giant green pack of cigarettes mountedon a truck, intercepted 90 percent of the rockets in the battle with IslamicJihad. The sophisticated system, developed with U.S. support, not only targetsincoming projectiles by firing a missile at them; it even calculates preciselywhere the threat might hit and works accordingly with a separate system ofsirens that warn Israelis to seek shelter.As in almost every attack sinceIsrael pulled its forces from Gaza in 2005, I went down to the border. Thearea has changed dramatically over the years. In 2008, before Operation CastLead, areas of Sderot, a border town, were dilapidated and depressing. Underfire, without any protection, the people were traumatized. Now there are newparks and shopping centers. Israel didn’t go to war on November 12 because itdidn’t need to, and it sees diminishing returns in entering Gaza and gettingbogged down in fighting. It also knows that civilian casualties would result.In Cast Lead, around 1,400 Palestinians were killed; in the Gaza war in 2014,more than 2,400, according to estimates. Gaza is densely populated; imaginetrying to fight a war in Manhattan. Civilians will suffer.However, the volumeof rocket fire from Gaza in the past year and the extent of Israeli airstrikesare as large as in previous wars. In July 2018, Israel struck 40 targets inwhat it said were the largest strikes since the 2014 war. In November 2018,around 500 rockets were fired. In response, Israel struck 160 targets thatmonth. In May 2019, more than 600 rockets were fired at Israel. In the recentbattle with Islamic Jihad, Israel hit around 20 PIJ targets. A mistakenairstrike also killed eight civilians from one Palestinian family.Israeldubbed its recent operation “Black Belt” and aimed it at deterring PIJ, whichposes a challenge for Israel if there is also conflict with Hezbollah in thenorth. Delivering a blow to the organization by killing a senior commander to“stabilize the situation” is what Jerusalem hoped to achieve. “Our assessmentshows we dealt a significant blow to PIJ’s capabilities,” an IDF spokesmansaid in a press briefing.This is Israel’s new way of war. It mirrors a type ofwar that most advanced Western countries, particularly the United States, nowfight. It involves precision airstrikes or special forces and complexintelligence-gathering through the use of satellites, cyber technology, andother sources. Gone are the days of heavy armor, of Israel’s Moshe Dayan orAmerica’s George Patton and all that. This “revolution in military affairs”that was unveiled in the early 1990s mandates the use of technology and nowinvolves “asymmetry,” which basically means that on one side you have an F-35and on the other you have a guy with an AK-47. It’s not simple in reality,because groups such as Islamic Jihad have developed long-range rockets, withIran’s backing.Nevertheless, in the overall picture, Israel has reachedextreme precision in its airstrikes, putting a missile in a bedroom ratherthan taking out a whole house. Air defense, including Iron Dome and othersystems such as the U.S.-made Patriot, enable Jerusalem to avoid a ground warand to focus on the Iranian threat. This is a major revolution for Israel.Thirteen years ago the country was dragged into a conflict with Hezbollah inLebanon and suffered many early setbacks on the ground. That war taught Israelthat its decade and a half of fighting Palestinian terror in the West Bank andGaza had degraded the army’s ability to engage in a larger complexconflict.Now Israel prefers to prepare for the larger conflict with Iranian-backed groups while managing the conflict in Gaza and carrying out airstrikesin Syria against Iranian targets that are largely shrouded in secrecy. Theseprecise strikes, such as one on a Hezbollah “killer drone” team in August,could lead to a larger conflict. As it faces a variety of threats, fromHezbollah and other Iranian-backed groups, Israel will have to use its airdefense against major rocket threats, relying on the tactics it honed in theprecision strikes. New technologies enabled Israel to refrain from majorconflicts with the Palestinians. In the next war, they will be tested on amuch larger scale, on multiple fronts.

Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:16:31 -0500	Corbyn Catches Up With Johnson in Dramatic U.K. Election Debate	https://news.yahoo.com/corbyn-catches-johnson-dramatic-u-213442076.html	(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, follow us @Brexit and subscribeto our podcast.Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn defied his negative ratings to drawlevel with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a crucial television debate aheadof the U.K.’s general election.The opposition leader, who’s been laggingbehind Johnson in personal approval scores, effectively tied with the premierin a snap poll on which candidate won the clash Tuesday night. The poundremained lower after the survey.The YouGov/Sky News poll of 1,600 people gaveJohnson a narrow victory, with 51% saying he won the ITV debate, against 49%saying Corbyn performed best.That was a significant turnaround for Corbyn, 70,who has struggled to persuade the public that he is prime minister material.Hewent into the election campaign with a net satisfaction rating of minus 60.That was by far the lowest such score since IpsosMORI started tracking theratings in 1979. Johnson’s score stood at plus 2 when the figures werecompiled at the end of October.While Corbyn fared better than expected thistime, his party remains stuck behind the Conservatives in the polls. It wasonly one debate, and more are planned, including another head-to-head betweenthe two leaders on Dec. 6.The YouGov verdict followed an hour of clashesbetween the two men vying to lead the U.K. in what is one of the higheststakes elections in recent British history.When voters cast their ballots onDec. 12, they will face a choice between Johnson’s promise to deliver a speedyBrexit and Corbyn’s pledge to call another referendum on European Unionmembership that could ultimately allow the divorce to be canceled.Corbynreceived applause and landed verbal punches on Johnson, 55, who struggled towin over an audience that laughed and groaned as he tried to steer the topicback to Brexit.In his most successful moments, Corbyn said he would give theprime minister a festive present of Charles Dickens’s classic short story, ‘AChristmas Carol,’ so he could learn how “nasty” the miserly Scrooge was.Corbyn also attacked the royal family over its handling of Prince Andrew’sfriendship with the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, saying the monarchy needed“improvement.”Corbyn struggled to shake off allegations that antisemitism isrife inside the Labour Party, and was mocked by some audience members forclaiming his policy on Brexit was clear, when he could not say whether hewould vote to remain or leave the bloc in a referendum he’s promising to hold.But he won a cheer for promising to end the privatization of the NationalHealth Service.Johnson had one big message: That he could get Brexit done –and quickly. It served him well in the opening 20 minutes, but then hisrepeated attempts to make it all about Brexit began to look forced. Forexample, when trying to think of a Christmas gift for Corbyn, he said he’dsend him a copy of “my brilliant Brexit deal.”There were other awkward momentsfor the Tory leader. Some audience members laughed when Johnson said hebelieved trust was important in politics.The theme of trustworthiness alsofeatured in the spin battle between the rival parties afterward. Tory ForeignSecretary Dominic Raab appeared among reporters backstage in Salford,northwestern England, to say “there is a real issue of trust” with Corbyn’sBrexit stance. Labour’s trade spokesman accused Johnson of telling “lie afterlie after lie.” YouGov’s pollsters found Corbyn beat Johnson 45% to 40% ontrustworthiness.“The choice is very simple: we can get Brexit done or we canspend another year with another referendum,” Johnson said in his closingremarks. “If we have a working majority Conservative government, I pledge wewill have a Parliament that works for you, that focuses on the NHS and thecost of living, because when we get Brexit done by Jan. 31 we will goforward.”Corbyn used his final message of the night to promise to protect theNHS and invest in “good jobs” across the country. “Vote for hope and vote forLabour on the 12th of December,” he said.According to the YouGove poll, Corbynbeat Johnson 59% to 25% on being in touch with ordinary people. But Johnsonbeat Corbyn 54% to 29% on appearing prime ministerial and 54% to 37% on beinglikeable.Although the headline result was a draw, 67% of respondents thoughtCorbyn performed well, against 59% for Johnson. That suggested the Labourleader had done better than people thought he would.(Adds pound, quotes,context.)\\--With assistance from Greg Ritchie.To contact the reporters onthis story: Kitty Donaldson in Salford, England atkdonaldson1@bloomberg.net;Tim Ross in London at tross54@bloomberg.net;RobertHutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsiblefor this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.netFor morearticles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.

Col. Alexander Vindman was “embarrassing even for them.”“They tried to smear the recipient of a Purple Heart,” the late-night hostsaid, “to protect a president who doesn’t even have a red one.” Kimmel firstzeroed in on Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, who not only “implied thatVindman was a leaker” but also that he had “questionable judgement.” He thenadded, “You know, questionable judgement, like say if you were a wrestlingcoach and the team doctor was abusing your wrestlers. And you knew about itbut you didn’t say anything. That’s questionable judgement, right, JimJordan?”But as always, Kimmel saved his sickest burns for “the president’sthird favorite son.” During the hearing, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted, “Anyonelistening to Vindman stammer through this seemingly trying to remember theCatch Phrases he was well coached on should get that. He’s a low levelpartisan bureaucrat and nothing more.” “That’s right, the slicked-back spermsample who never served anybody is questioning the integrity of a lieutenantcolonel with a Purple Heart,” Kimmel shot back. “Daddy Bone Spurs must be veryproud of him.” “But that’s their strategy,” he continued, turning more seriousthan usual. “The goal of the Republicans is to smear them, to confuse us, tobore us, to question the loyalty and patriotism of lifelong civil servants andeven members of our military, who’ve served heroically. They are intentionallydamaging these Americans to protect the lowlife they know is a lowlife, butthey also know that defending him makes them popular amongst a certain group.So they do it anyway.” Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories inyour inbox every day.

Guo Xijin, 61, has fled the custody of state agents and has goneinto hiding, reported Catholic Asia News, a website, and cannot be immediatelyreached for comment. Mr Guo is part of a group of bishops that many religiousand human rights experts feared would be persecuted after the Vatican inked adeal with Beijing last year on the ordaining bishops. China has long insistedthat it approve appointments, clashing with absolute papal authority to pickbishops. The agreement broke that standoff, and could help pave the way forformal diplomatic ties, but also stoked worries that the Chinese state wouldhave too much power to regulate religion. Since Communism took hold in China,there have been in practice two Catholic churches - one sanctioned by thegovernment, and an underground one loyal to the Vatican, and it remainsunclear what would happen to bishops who refused to fall in line with thegovernment. China’s officially atheist Communist Party – has engaged in awidespread crackdown on religion in the last few years. Authorities havebanned Arab-style onion domes on mosques and other buildings – even if merelydecorative. The UN estimates more than a million Muslims have been detained inchilling “re-education” camps, where former detainees have told The Telegraphthey were subject to physical torture, psychological intimidation andpolitical indoctrination.

The document is due to be approved on aninformal basis this week by government envoys with formal sign off byministers due in December, and the wording is subject to changes.The EUstatement outlines the bloc’s position following a risk assessment thatdescribed a nightmare scenario where hackers or hostile states could takecontrol of everything from electricity grids to police communications. Itwarned against reliance on suppliers from countries with non-democraticsystems of government.U.S. and European officials have repeatedly flaggedconcerns about partnering with Chinese equipment makers, such as HuaweiTechnologies Co., for 5G networks. Chinese companies are obliged to assist thecountry’s national intelligence organization in their investigations, thoughChinese officials and Huawei have said there are exceptions to those rules andthe company wouldn’t necessarily be forced to do so.U.S. Secretary of StateMike Pompeo tweeted on Tuesday that the EU’s risk assessment report highlightshow nations should install 5G equipment and software only from companies thatwon’t threaten their security, privacy, intellectual property, or humanrights.Key parts of the next-generation infrastructure “such as componentscritical for national security, will only be sourced from trustworthyparties,” according to the draft statement of EU governments. The 5G build outshould be “firmly grounded in the core values of the EU, such as human rightsand fundamental freedoms, rule of law, protection of privacy, personal dataand intellectual property, in the commitment to transparency.”A spokesman forthe EU’s Council declined to comment on the content of the draftcommunique.German StanceEuropean countries have the ultimate say whether ornot to ban a supplier from their national networks for security reasons.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has decided to let Huawei supply some gear aslong as the company fulfills certain security standards, despite intensepressure from her own party for an outright ban.The draft also stresses “theneed to diversify suppliers in order to avoid or limit the creation of a majordependency on a single supplier” as well as “the importance of Europeantechnological sovereignty and promoting globally the EU approach to cybersecurity.”Besides Huawei, Europe’s Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB supply 5Gequipment.(Updates with U.S. Secretary of State’s tweet in fifth paragraph.)Tocontact the reporters on this story: Nikos Chrysoloras in Brussels atnchrysoloras@bloomberg.net;Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels atndrozdiak1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story:Chad Thomas at cthomas16@bloomberg.net, ;Giles Turner atgturner35@bloomberg.net, Amy Thomson, Richard BravoFor more articles likethis, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.

LieutenantGeneral Saad al-Allaq, head of Iraq’s Military Intelligence, claimed in aninterview with CNN that Iraq has given Ankara dossiers on nine alleged leadersof Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil), including top financiers forthe terror group. The general said senior Isil figures known as ""emirs"" haveaccess to vast reserves of cash and were forming new cells in Turkey. Heclaimed many of them had managed to escape from Isil’s final patch ofterritory in Baghouz, eastern Syria, after bribing Western-backed SyrianDemocratic Forces (SDF) to reach Idlib in the north-west. From there, he said,they crossed the border to Gaziantep in southern Turkey. ""Some of itsimportant leadership fled north, I mean in the direction of neighbouringcountries and into border areas like Gazientep,"" Lt. Gen. Allaq said. USSpecial Forces, figures at lower right, moving toward compound of IslamicState leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Credit: Department of Defense ""They havesecretly crossed into these areas from the Syrian-Turkish border - top leaderswho have money. They crossed with the help of smugglers by paying large amountof money and have secretly entered Turkish territory."" He added: ""Thoseelements who are right now in Turkey play a key role in the recruitment offighters and terrorists."" CNN was shown Iraq’s arrest warrants for the ninemen, who are described as bomb makers. Lt. Gen. Allaq said the men were ""amongthe best bomb makers that Isis ever had."" Lt. Gen. Allaq, who rarely givesinterviews, said Iraq had intelligence that Isil leaders were planningjailbreaks of its supporters held in prisons and camps across Syria and Iraq.Isil members are led away to be questioned by coalition forces aftersurrendering, near Baghuz, eastern Syria Credit: Sam Tarling Turkey told theUS network they were looking into the allegations. He said a new Isil missioncode-named ""Break Down the Fences"" intended to storm jails where theirfollowers were being held and try to replenish its manpower. Several high-profile Isil figures and their family members have been discovered in recentweeks in or near Turkey. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group’s leader, was foundhiding three miles from the border of Turkey in the Syria village of Barishain Idlib, where he was killed in a US raid on October 26. Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, Isil’s spokesman, was killed the following day several miles awaynear the town of Jarablus, which is under Turkish administration.

The Royal Mint acted after Prime Minister BorisJohnson requested a delay until Jan. 31.As Bloomberg revealed in October, someof the coins had already been made when Johnson wrote to the EU asking for aBrexit extension. But the extent of his government’s over-confidence was onlyfully revealed on Tuesday.A spokeswoman for the mint confirmed around onemillion Oct. 31 Brexit coins were made and will now be destroyed. The responsecame after a freedom of information request by the Daily Telegraph newspaper.She wouldn’t comment on the cost of the production and destruction of thecoins, but the price will ultimately be borne by taxpayers.In 2007, a 50 pencepiece was produced to celebrate 100 years of the boy scout movement, bearingthe legend “be prepared.” Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid and theTreasury may have taken that advice too literally.To contact the reporter onthis story: Thomas Penny in London at tpenny@bloomberg.netTo contact theeditors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, AdamBlenfordFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019Bloomberg L.P.
