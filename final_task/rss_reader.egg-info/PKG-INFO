Description: ## Iteration 1
        RSS reader is a command utility, which receives RSS URL and prints the result in convenient output format
        
        Input data has the following interface:
        
        `rss_reader.py source [-h] [--version] [--verbose] [--json] [--limit LIMIT]`
        ````
        positional arguments:
        source - URL which provides a RSS feed
        optional arguments:
        -h - prints this help page
        --version - prints in stdout current version
        --verbose - prints all logs in stdout
        --json - prints news in JSON format
        --limit LIMIT - limits the amount of news entries in the output 
        ````
        JSON structure:
        ```
        [
        	{
        		"title":   "A black man was put in handcuffs after a police officer stopped him on a trainplatform because he was eating",
        		"article": "Bay Area Rapid Transit police said Steve Foster, of Concord, California,violated state law by eating a sandwich on a BART station's platform.  ",
        		"links": [
        			"https://news.yahoo.com/black-man-put-handcuffs-police-170516695.html",
        			"http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iLcp4eQPeHI64PZ9LpeQcw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/e4254e78d7432dae4387d72624ee3086"
        		],
        		"link": "https://news.yahoo.com/black-man-put-handcuffs-police-170516695.html",
        		"date": "Mon, 11 Nov 2019 17:06:55 -0500"
        	},
        	{
        		...
        	},
        	...
        ]
        ```
        
        ## Iteration 2
        to run rss parser on your computer you need to:
        1) clone repository from https://github.com/ElizabethUniverse/FinalTaskRssParser
        2) `$cd final_task`
        3)  `$python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
        4)  `$cd dist`
        3) `$pip install rss_reader-1.1.tar.gz`
        4) run `$rss_reader https://news.yahoo.com/rss --limit 2 --verbose`
        
        
        ## Iteration 3
        News is stored in the csv cache in following format and with tab delimiter.
        
        `date    title    link   article   list_links`
        
        Now we are searching for the news in the cache with O(n) complexity. But in the near future we plan to optimize this process.
        
        If you want to receive news for the 15/11/2019, please enter the following command in the command line
        
        `$python rss_reader.py https://news.yahoo.com/rss --date 20191115`
        
        --date argument works without internet connection and with --verbose, --json, --limit LIMIT arguments the same way.
        
        ##Iteration 4 
        
        News can be converted to pdf or html.
