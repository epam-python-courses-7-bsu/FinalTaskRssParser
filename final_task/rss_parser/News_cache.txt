Description:
 ('Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said Monday that reports detailing the involvement of President '
 'Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the White House’s Ukraine policy were “deeply troubling.”“What I see '
 'right now troubles me. I see a state of conflict between the foreign policy professionals and someone who says '
 'he’s acting on behalf of the president but frankly I don’t know if that is the case,” Rice said at a conference '
 'in Abu Dhabi. “This is just not a good thing. The world shouldn’t get confusing messages from the United States '
 'of America.”Multiple witnesses have alleged in house testimony that Giuliani conducted his own investigative '
 'work without regard for the administration’s formal policy.William Taylor, the former top American diplomat in '
 'Ukraine, whose testimony was released last week, asserted\xa0that Giuliani was actively undermining U.S. '
 'foreign policy.“The irregular channel seemed to focus on specific issues, specific cases, rather than the '
 'regular channel’s focus on institution building,” Taylor said, according to the transcript. “So the irregular '
 'channel, I think under the influence of Mr. Giuliani, wanted to focus on one or two specific cases, '
 'irrespective of whether it helped solve the corruption problem, fight the corruption problem.”Earlier Monday, '
 'news broke that Lev Parnas, an associate of Giuliani, will tell investigators that Giuliani attempted to '
 'leverage an official visit from Vice President Mike Pence to coax Ukraine into announcing an investigation into '
 'Joe Biden&#39;s son Hunter&#39;s business connections to Burisma.Rice also said she thought Trump’s mention of '
 'former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma, '
 'during the call was “out of bounds.”“The call is murky, it is really murky. I don’t like for the president of '
 'the United States to mention an American citizen for investigation to a foreign leader,” Rice said.')
