# That's how it works

* Creating RSSParser class object
* Using feedparser to get a page with function parse
* Then using output functions get info from the page
* Info (source link, image link, etc.) for every novelty pack in class Novelty
* Create a pack of news filled with Novelty class objects
* When a pack of news is done come back to rss_parser.py
* Here we prepare to output info according to arguments from console
* Checking arguments, output the info
